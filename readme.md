# Blackjack in C++ From Console

Blackjack game from console

## Getting Started

This Project is written in Visual Studio 19, with C++17 compiler. However code should be portable just download the src folder and compile and link files under it. 

### Prerequisites

You need a cpp compiler later than C++11 to be able to recompile source files, in my machine I have used MSVC C++ 17

### Using
Just run the program it interactively asks you what to do

## Deployment

It would be nice to have web interface where user play the game.


## Contributing

I didn't do extensive unit tests, if you can spot error, or have suggestions for improvement feel free to implement them and pull request. Or simply make suggestions to me for features, improvements. In my spare time I may implement them.
